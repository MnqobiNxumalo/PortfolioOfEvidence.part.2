Description of changes and improvements made: 

Changes and improvements had to be made in order to meet the required requirements for the Recipe. 
Firstly, in my code I had to change and use generic collections to store the recipes and other values instead of using arrays.
My Recipe app required a function or feature to search for the name of the Recipe, this feature makes it easier for the user to search and get specific results in a short period of time. 
The list of recipes is also required to appear in alphabetical order. For each ingredient, it should allow a user to be able to enter calories and shows which food group does it belongs to.
